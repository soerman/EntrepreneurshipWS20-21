\properparagraph{Name the ten rules for good Business Design.}
\\[-6ex]
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Good business model design depends as much on art and intuition as it does on science
	and analysis.
	\item Good business model design requires deep knowledge of customer needs and the
	technological and organizational resources that might meet those needs.
	\item All good business models require an understanding of current business models at work in
	the market. Most new business model designs involve the hybridizations of others.
	\item Alignment and coherence is desirable so that the business model elements will be
	mutually reinforcing.
	\item Strategic analysis must be tied to business model design and vice versa. Strategy guides
	business model design and is also to some extent shaped by it.
	\item Business models should be coupled with strategies and assets that make imitation
	difficult. Imitation will occur sooner or later, and pioneers must be fast learners.
	\item Identifying the customer segment(s) to focus on first in order to learn and achieve
	proof-of-concept and business model viability is a critical capability.
	\item When n-sided markets are involved, getting started early and effectively seeding the
	n sides is critical.
	\item Good business model reengineering skills are an important component of strong
	dynamic capabilities. They enable proficient seizing.
	\item The introduction of new business models into an existing organization is always
	difficult and may require a separate organizational unit.	
\end{enumerate}

\properparagraph{What is a Start-Up \& what is a Lean Start-Up according to Ries?}

	\item \textbf{Lean Start-up:} Lean Startup is a method to systematically reduce the risk of	projects with high uncertainty.
\end{itemize}

\properparagraph{What are the six stages of validated learning according to Ries?}

	\item \textbf{BUILD:} Build experiment
	\item \textbf{PRODUCT:} Minimum viable product
	\item \textbf{MEASURE:} Run experiment, record data
